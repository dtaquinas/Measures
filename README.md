# Measures
Stuff for Jacobi matrices, spectral measures, Szego recursion, etc.

# Examples
Currently there is only one example: the modified Bessel polynomials.
The program mbessel.cc will compute the Verblunsky coefficients of the modified Bessel weight, as well as the Jacobi matrix entries of the associated measure on the real line (which by a version of the Damanik-Killip theorem is really a measure on [-2, 2]).
